Dylan Web in 60 Seconds
=======================

This is a series of examples showing how to do web programming in
`Dylan <https://opendylan.org>`_. It was inspired
by a version of `the same thing written for Twisted Python
<https://docs.twistedmatrix.com/en/stable/web/howto/web-in-60>`_. In
Twisted, it is often the case that very little code is required to get
something basic running, which has also been an inspiration to create
similarly simple APIs for the Dylan web infrastructure.
