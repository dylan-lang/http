This file seems to be mostly about DSP issues.

* When debugging it could be really useful to have process-template output
  <!-- begin template foo.dsp --> and <!-- end template foo.dsp --> into
  the generated page.

* Need a way to define a <page> that's 100% dynamic.  i.e., it requires
  no template.  This would be useful for creating simple default pages
  in the code and avoiding complicated packaging problems.  e.g., see
  the return-to-origin method's default: keyword.  If none supplied it
  could default to a dynamic error page.

* SQL-ODBC: if you try to insert the empty string into a CHAR(n) column you
  get an error.  Should check this out.

* The template parser should complain clearly if the %dsp:include
  directive doesn't have the "url" attribute.  ("uri" should work as a
  synonym?)

* The error you get for unrecognized tags is pretty bad:

  Dylan error: The system cannot find the file specified.
  : Can't get attributes of D:\sigue\bug-tracker\btrack\dsp\<!--TAG%20PARSE%20ERROR--> 

  These were in the log:

  2002-09-23 21:09:37 [WARN] In template "D:\\sigue\\bug-tracker\\btrack\\dsp\\home.dsp", the tag "show-messages" was not found.
  2002-09-23 21:09:37 [WARN] In template "D:\\sigue\\bug-tracker\\btrack\\dsp\\home.dsp", the tag "image" was not found.
  2002-09-23 21:09:37 [WARN] In template "D:\\sigue\\bug-tracker\\btrack\\dsp\\home.dsp", the tag "current-login" was not found.
  2002-09-23 21:09:37 [INFO] get /<!--TAG%20PARSE%20ERROR--> http/1.1

  Clearly need to include the tag name in the error message.

* "define page" should expand to some method definition that gets called
  on startup rather than expanding directly to calls to make.  This
  would avoid some of the dependency problems, like having to call
  start-server early.  (How will this problem be affected when http-server
  loads DLLs at runtime?)

* Will need something like process-html to use in iteration tags.

* In JSP I can put a URL like "recordServlet?id=<bt:some_tag/>" in a page
  and if recordServlet has to redirect to a login page (for example) then
  that login page can just forward to the originally requested URL when
  it's done.  This can be convenient.  In DSP I guess I can just have the
  recordServlet page store ALL the query values in the session and then
  do the redirection, but it's worth considering whether it's worth having
  a way to explicitly forward to a URL and/or page.

* The warning about 'the tag "foo" was not found' should say what taglibs
  were searched.  (And it would be extra cool to say if a matching tag
  exists in some other taglib.)

* DSP should warn when a matching close tag isn't found, or if a close
  tag with an unrecognized taglib name is found.  e.g., I put 
  <dsp:row>...<bt:row> by accident and it failed to warn.
