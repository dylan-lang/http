<!-- If DEBUG-SERVER is on then Koala will not try to gracefully handle errors
     thrown during the execution of a server request.  Only turn this on when
     running inside a development environment, or the server will crash.  This
     should also be near the beginning of the log file if you want to debug
     config file loading.

<!-- Log messages come in three types: HTTP requests, errors, and
     debug/info messages.  Where these log messages are stored is
     determined by the <request-log>, <error-log> and <debug-log>
     configuration settings, respectively.  Logging can be configured
     to send all messages to the same place, or to separate them out
     into different files.  The request-log messages follow a
     specific format like that of other web servers which can be
     parsed by automated tools.  Errors and debug info are more free
     form.

     Each virtual host has its own request, error, and debug log
     targets, but by default they all forward their log messages to
     the log targets set for the default virtual host, which in turn
     defaults to logging to stdout/stderr.

     The following options are recognized for each of the three
     logging configuration options:

       name     - Loggers are arranged in a hierarchy based on their
                  names.  This can be used, along with additivity
                  (below), to flexibly arrange logging to either
                  multiple files or just one, and to combine different
                  types of log messages together or separately.

       additive - Whether the logger should pass log messages on to
                  its parent logger.  Default is off.

       location - A filename relative to the server root directory.
                  If not specified, stderr will be used for the error
                  log and stdout will be used for everything else.

       max-size - The maximum size in bytes before the log is
                  rotated.  Only useful if location is specified.

       format   - A format control string that determines what each
                  log line will look like.  The default value is:
                  "%{date} %-5{level} [%{thread}] %{message}"
                  Other options are %{millis} and %{pid}.  You get
                  the idea.

     The logs should be configured near the beginning of this config
     file so debugging statements emitted during config file parsing
     can be displayed.
