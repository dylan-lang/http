  <H2>Header Parsing</H2>

  <h3>*max-single-header-size* :: false-or(&lt;integer&gt;) = 16384</H3>
    If not <b>#f</b>, puts a total limit on the size of any particular
    header field.  Setting a limit helps to prevent broken clients (or
    intentional DoS attacks) from overtaxing server resources.
  <h3>*header-buffer-growth-amount* :: &lt;integer&gt; = 1024</h3>
    Can be set to control the "chunk" size of buffers used by
    <b>read-message-headers</b>.
  <h3>&lt;header-table&gt;</h3>
    An explicit-key collection used to map the string representing
    a header field name to the data in that field.
    The data is typically a string, but if a header
    field name occurs more than once in the header, then the data for that header
    field will be a sequence of the strings corresponding to each occurance of
    the header field.
  <h3>read-message-headers (stream :: &lt;stream&gt;)
  =&gt; (headers :: &lt;header-table&gt;)</h3>
    Reads CRLF-terminated lines from <b>stream</b> until it encounters a blank
    line, and parses them as http headers.

  <h2>General</h2>
   <h3>&lt;attlist&gt;</h3>
   An <b>&lt;attlist&gt;</b> is an explicit key collection used to represent certain
   HTTP values and header field components. It provides a mapping
   from attribute names (represented by strings) to their values.  In that respect
   it behaves just like a case-insensitive string table, and you can use <b>element</b>
   to find the value of a given attribute. However, an <b>&lt;attlist&gt;</b>
   has additional properties.  First, it is an ordered mapping, remembering
   the original order of the attributes.  The original order is respected
   in iteration and in the value of <b>key-sequence</b>.  Second, an <b>&lt;attlist&gt;</b>
   may have multiple occurances of the same key, representing the case where the
   same attribute was specified multiple times.  <b>element</b> always returns the
   first value of an attribute, but you can use iteration to find all the values.
   And finally, the <b>&lt;attlist&gt;</b> itself may have a value, which you can
   obtain by calling <b>attvalue</b>.  This value is typically used when the attributes
   represented by the <b>&lt;attlist&gt;</b> are the attributes of some particular object.
   <b>attvalue</b> will then return the object itself.

   <h3>element(attlist :: &lt;attlist&gt;, attribute :: &lt;string&gt;, #key default) => (obj :: &lt;object&gt;)</h3>
    Returns the (first) value of <b>attribute</b> in <b>attlist</b>.

   <h3>attvalue(attlist :: &lt;attlist&gt;) =&gt; (obj :: &lt;object&gt;)</h3>
    Returns the value associated with the attlist.
   <h3>attvalue-setter(obj :: &lt;object&gt;, attlist :: &lt;attlist&gt;) =&gt; (obj :: &lt;object&gt;)</h3>
    Sets the value associated with the attlist.

  <h2>Request header values</h2>
    <h3>header-value(key :: &ltsymbol&gt)</h3>
    Returns <b>#f</b> if no request header field named <b>key</b> was specified,
    otherwise returns the parsed value of the request header field specified by <b>key</b>.
    The value is cached so asking for it multiple times is efficient.
    <p>
    By default, the parsed value is just the string containing the
    header field data, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
    If the field was specified more than one time, the data is
    concatenated using commas.  For example given request headers:
    <pre>X-Frob: data1
Y-Frib: a, b
X-Frob: data2</pre>
    then
    <b>header-value(#"Y-Frib")</b> returns <b>"a, b"</b> and
    <b>header-value(#"X-Frob")</b> returns <b>"data1, data2"</b>.
    <p>
    Certain headers have more specialized parsing behavior and return
    more complex data structures.  These are documented below.

   <h3>header-value(key == #"accept")</h3>
    Returns <b>#f</b> if no <b>Accept</b> header was specified, otherwise
    returns a sequence of attlists.  Each attlist represents a parametrized
    media type:  the atvalue is the pair <b>#(type . subtype)</b> and the
    attributes correspond to the parameters.  For example, given the request header:
    <pre>Accept: text/html;level=1;q=0.4, */*;q=0.5</pre>
    then <b>header-value(#"accept")</b> is a sequence of two attlists,
    with <b>header-value(#"accept")[0].atvalue = #("text" . "html")</b>,
    <b>header-value(#"accept")[0]["Level"] = 1</b>, and
    <b>header-value(#"accept")[1]["q"] = 0.5</b>.

   <h3>header-value(key == #"accept-charset")</h3>
   Returns <b>#f</b> if no <b>Accept-Charset</b> header was specified, otherwise
   returns an attlist mapping a charset name to its qvalue.  The atvalue of the
   attlist is not used.

   <h3>header-value(key == #"accept-encoding")</h3>
   Returns <b>#f</b> if no <b>Accept-Charset</b> header was specified, otherwise
   returns an attlist, mapping a content encoding name to its qvalue.  The atvalue
   of the attlist is not used.

   <h3>header-value(key == #"accept-language")</h3>
   Returns <b>#f</b> if no <b>Accept-Charset</b> header was specified, otherwise
   returns an attlist, mapping a language or language range name to its qvalue.
   The atvalue of the attlist is not used.

   <h3>header-value(key == #"authorization")</h3>
   Returns <b>#f</b> if no <b>Authorization</b> header was specified, otherwise
   returns the credentials.  If the credentials use the digest authentication method,
   returns an attlist corresponding to the specified parameters (the atvalue is not
   used).  For the basic authentication method, returns the string containing the
   authentication data.

   <h3>header-value(key == #"cache-control")</h3>
   Returns <b>#f</b> if no <b>Cache-Control</b> header was specified, otherwise
   returns an attlist of all the cache control parameters.  The atvalue is not
   used.
