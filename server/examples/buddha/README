Installing buddha
=================

Open Dylan:
  download latest tarball from
   http://www.gwydiondylan.org/downloads/opendylan/
  and follow the instructions in README provided by the tarball.

buddha:
 check out source code:
 svn co svn://anonsvn.gwydiondylan.org/scm/svn/dylan/trunk/libraries/

 will check out source to libraries/
 
 export FUNCTIONAL_DEVELOPER_USER_REGISTRIES=`pwd`/libraries/registry
 or, in tcsh:
 setenv FUNCTIONAL_DEVELOPER_USER_REGISTRIES `pwd`/libraries/registry

 then run
  opendylan -build buddha
 you should end up with a ~/bin/buddha binary

Configuring buddha
==================
 first copy and modify the http server config:
  mkdir config
  cp libraries/http/server/config/config.xml config/
  edit config/config.xml

At least
<buddha content-directory = "/home/hannes/dylan/libraries/koala/www/" />
has to be added.

It is also a good idea to have an absolute path in the
<server-root location="/absolute_path/to/libraries/koala" />
element.

Hmm, that's all I'd guess.


Running buddha
==============

run ~/bin/buddha
there should be a http-listener on the configured port

Security considerations
=======================

Save/restore: always (when user submits a filename during save,
and when user chooses a file during restore) converts user input
to a base64-encoded string
 -> no directory traversal or other malformed filenames
-> even malformed GET/POST requests will be base64-encoded
