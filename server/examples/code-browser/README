* Start the code-browser app with one command-line argument: the server
  config file pathname.

* Use a config file that points to
  libraries/network/koala/www/code-browser as the document root.

* Go to one of these URLs:
  /symbol/<library-name>
  /symbol/<library-name>/<module-name>
  /symbol/<library-name>/<module-name>/<definition-name>
  /search?search=xxx  (seems to have problems)
